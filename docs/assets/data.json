    "desc":  "Welcome to our final project for Network Science! Ever thought about staying in a wealthy part of a city but weren’t sure how expensive paying for an Airbnb would be? The premise of our project is to demonstrate how Airbnb prices in a city are related to that city’s wealth distribution. Scroll down to find links to interactive maps of San Francisco, Austin, and New York City displaying the data points of price listings on top of median household income. By exploring these maps you might notice that even in areas with higher income households, there are still Airbnb listings with relatively low prices. So, before you plan your next trip, don’t count out any options!"

  "description": "To see areas of each city in more detail, zoom in and out using the “+” and “-” buttons. The more you zoom in, the clearer each individual listing becomes. In some areas of our maps, all five quintiles of Airbnb listings can be found in a single real estate block! On the top left corner you have the option to click the arrow button to filter and view some of the map layer details. You will be able to view all of our layers in the “Content” section, and also select which layers to view at a time. The default view displays all the layers at once, but feel free to toggle on and off each quintile map layer of the Airbnb listings. To understand the color scheme of each map, click on “Legend” on the left side of the map. Here you will see an explanation of what the color of each Airbnb listing data point corresponds to in terms of pricing quintile and pricing range. You can also view the legend for the 2019 median household income layer and the income ranges each block color corresponds to. Lastly, you can click a data point to reveal additional details, including the neighborhood, nightly price, latitude, and longitude of that Airbnb listing. Clicking on a block group will display the median household income of that area in comparison to the national median household income, and a bar graph categorizing median household income by age groups. You can hover over each bar of the graph to show the exact median household income for that specific age group."
